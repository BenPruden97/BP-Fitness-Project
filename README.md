# Code Validation

At the end of building my website, I found these two websites to validate my code

* I used [CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) to check the validation of my CSS code.
* I used [HTML validator](https://validator.w3.org/) to check the validation of my HTML code.

By checking the validation of my code using these two websites, I found a lot of small errors that I was able to change within my code that was incorrect.

One example was the incorrect code I had for comments within my code.

I had written my comments like this <! ----- content ----- !> and the code validator told me this was a warning
