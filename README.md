# Issues I have found during the development of my website



## Horizontal scrolling bar at the bottom of my website

To fix this I created two classes in my style.css file.
The first class I created was for .row and I gave that the elements of margin-right and margin-left the value of 0.
The second class I created was for .container-fluid and I gave this the elements of padding-right and padding left the value of 0.
